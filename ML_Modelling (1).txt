Linear regression is process of drawing lines best possible way through all data points
Practically it is not possible to draw a straight line through all data points.
we will draw multiple lines and calculate the error(means the distance between a model line and each data point)
calculate the sum of all the distances.
whichever model line is having the minimum sum of distances we will select the model line as model.
