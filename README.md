# DataScienceIntern
Welcome to data science world free resources and projects.

This repository contains my daily progress and project work during my 3-month data science internship at RamanaSoft, Hyderabad. Throughout this internship, I have been involved in various tasks, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment. The repository showcases hands-on work with machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and data visualization techniques using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Power BI.

Each dayâ€™s progress is documented with well-structured code, insights, and explanations, providing a step-by-step record of my learning and contributions. The projects in this repository highlight real-world applications of data science, including predictive modeling, classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation systems. Additionally, I have worked with SQL for database queries and data extraction, and I have explored tools for model deployment and API integration.

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my practical experience, demonstrating my ability to handle end-to-end data science workflows and solve business problems using data-driven approaches.
